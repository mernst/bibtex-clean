# bibtex-clean #

Clean a BibTeX file by removing text outside BibTeX entries.

Remove each non-empty line that is not in a BibTeX entry, except retain any line
that starts with "%".

Arguments are the names of the original files. Cleaned copies of those files are
written in the **current directory**. Therefore, this should be run in a
different directory from where the argument files are, to avoid overwriting
them.
